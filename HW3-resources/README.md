Functionality-------------------------
I created this password generator in order to create a password that meets the user's parameters, which include the length (between 8-128 characters) and character type. The user is prompted whenever they are missing any criteria. Once the criteria has been met, the user can generate a password, and copy it with a single left click on the copy button. Then if the user wants to remove the text from the screen, all they have to do is click the erase button. Password Generator Deluxe truly is a magnificent beast.




My Journey----------------------------
Originally I created the HTML file with all the javascript code inside. I then got the password generator working properly with prompts and confirms. Then I moved the javascript code into its own file. I then built the front end of the html page. After I was content with the aesthetic, I added the password generator functionality with buttons, check boxes, and textareas. I attempted to make the webpage scalable. Even though I am not totally happy with visual aspect, I am please with the functionality. I believe I ironed out all possible bugs.

... Yes, that is a challenge. Try to find a bug.
