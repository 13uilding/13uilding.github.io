Title: My First Portfolio Website

Purpose:

I created this website for multiple reasons. One reason is because it was a homework assignment. I was supposed to follow a certain aesthetic, and I did that for the most part. Despite the homework aspect of this assignment, I learned plenty about HTML/CSS. I struggled with getting my banner/header operating properly for more than an hour. Eventually I realized my clearfix was missing the pseudo-element "::after." I patted myself on the back and hit my hand to my forehead. I continued to struggle through making other aspects of this portfolio, such as the portfolio photos, the text forms, and following directions. I learned a lot about the process, and I hope that my next portfolio can be even better than the first iteration. I have now been introduced to bootstrap, so I will probably use that in the future. I am glad that I was able to hand code the vast majority of this page on my own. It isn't optimal, and I would refractor it for a couple of more hours if I had the time. I don't have the time, and it doesn't have to be perfect. Let me describe my page to you.

Description of my page:

My portfolio website was originally created with 3 different pages. The about page has my picture along with two paragraphs describing a little about me. The top of the page has my banner/header, which displays my name as well as navigation links to all three pages. I noticed that the banner starts to look weird as you shrink the page horizontally. CURRENTLY THERE IS A PINK SPACE THAT APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM. I can eliminate this issue by applying a push element at the bottom of the page above the sticky footer. I set it to 300px, so I don't see it. I don't know why it shows up, but I don't like it. I don't want to program anymore so that is my fix.

My second page is my portfolio page. It has the header/banner just like the first page. In addition, it also has example animals, which are supposed to represent potential portfolio pages and links in the future. THE ELEPHANT PICTURE IS NOT THE SAME SIZE AS THE OTHER PICTURES. I DIDN'T WANT TO INVEST THE TIME TO CHANGE THE SIZES TO MATCH PERFECTLY.

My final page is a contact's page. Again the top section is the same as the other pages, so there is a feel to my website. Below the top I have some input boxes that I copied from w3schools. I changed the code a little bit.
