Title: My First Portfolio Website

Purpose:

I created this website for multiple reasons. One reason is because it was a homework assignment. I was supposed to follow a certain aesthetic, and I did that for the most part. Despite the homework aspect of this assignment, I learned plenty about HTML/CSS. I struggled with getting my banner/header operating properly for more than an hour. Eventually I realized my clearfix was missing the pseudo-element "::after." I patted myself on the back and hit my hand to my forehead. I continued to struggle through making other aspects of this portfolio, such as the portfolio photos, the text forms, and following directions. I learned a lot about the process, and I hope that my next portfolio can be even better than the first iteration. I have now been introduced to bootstrap, so I will probably use that in the future. I am glad that I was able to hand code the vast majority of this page on my own. It isn't optimal, and I would refractor it for a couple of more hours if I had the time. I don't have the time, and it doesn't have to be perfect. Let me describe my page to you.

Description of my page:

My portfolio website was originally created with 3 different pages. The about page has my picture along with two paragraphs describing a little about me. The top of the page has my banner/header, which displays my name as well as navigation links to all three pages. I noticed that the banner starts to look weird as you shrink the page horizontally. CURRENTLY THERE IS A PINK SPACE THAT APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM. I STILL NEED TO ADD THE STICKY BANNER, SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE FIXED. I BUILT THE PAGE WITHOUT LOOKED AT THE STYLING HINTS, SO MY WIDTH IS NOT THE SAME AS WHAT WAS INTENDED IN THE DIRECTION. I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE NOW. I LIKE MY AESTHETIC.

My second page is my portfolio page. It has the header/banner just like the first page. In addition, it also has example animals, which are supposed to represent potential portfolio pages and links in the future. CURRENTLY I NEED TO ADD DUMBY LINKS TO EACH OF THE PICTURES. THE ELEPHANT PICTURE IS NOT THE SAME SIZE AS THE OTHER PICTURES. I DIDN'T WANT TO INVEST THE TIME TO CHANGE THE SIZES TO MATCH PERFECTLY. MAYBE I'LL CENTER THE TEXT IN THE H3.

My final page is a contact's page. Again the top section is the same as the other pages, so there is a feel to my website. Below the top I have some input boxes that I copied from w3schools. I changed the code a little bit. CURRENTLY MY SUBMIT BUTTON BREAKS EVERYTHING SO I'LL HAVE TO CHANGE THAT.
