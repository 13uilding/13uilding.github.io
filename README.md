I created a basic portfolio website that has three pages. The about page has a picture of me and two paragraphs describing me. The portfolio page has some cards which have links inside of them which potentially could link to future projects. The contact page has a place to fill in name, email address, and message for me. It isn't linked up currently.  I decided not to add the sticky footer at the bottom.
