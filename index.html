        My name is Dan Brown, and I am 27 years old. I graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in Physics and a minor in Math and Philosophy. Most people find the combination of Philosophy and Physics to be peculiar, but I disagree. I believe there is plenty of overlap. Physics is focused on understanding the universe primarily through models rooted in Mathematics. Philosophy is focused on understanding everything primarily through arguments rooted in language. These languages can be spoken, logical, or mathematical. If you take the (overlap) of these two fields, it is clear that I am interested in understanding through mathematics.

        Currently, I have been expanding my knowledge horizon by studying web development and programming. I am fascinated by the massive structure that provides millions of people with entertainment, jobs, medicine, flights, and everything that we take for granted daily. I want to become part of the excitement, so I decided to attend a coding bootcamp to kickstart my technological development. Thanks for viewing my website, and I hope that my projects will give you a better idea of my abilities. Feel free to contact me with any questions you might have.
